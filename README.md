# Mxthess_MC_Commands
This is Spigot plugin for better commands like /gmc and more

This is a testing Plugin so it maybe has some bugs or problems and of course, you don't have a file of .jar you need some application to make a .jar file I recommended this: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/ and of course Minecraft plug-in in that app

If i get full version i will send .jar to my website to download.
